## Outcome

* Used HTML **forms** to take information from the user.
* Used CSS **grid** and **flex** to manage layout.
* Used **JavaScript** to apply functionality.
* Used **Git** and **GitHub** for project management.
* Tried to maintain **clean code**.

## What I learned

* Better knowledge and it's practical usability of **HTML forms**, **CSS Grid and Flexbox** and the **use of DOM and eventlisteners in JavaScript**.
* A lot of minor things.
